            ‚ö†Ô∏è **UI Changes Detected Without Galen Tests!**
            It looks like one or more \`.html\` files were modified, but no changes were made in the \`tests/galen/\` directory.

            Please **self-certify** that you manually tested the UI changes:

            - [ ] I have manually tested the UI changes in different browsers.
            - [ ] No visual regressions were found.
            - [ ] The changes work as expected in all required screen sizes.
            - [ ] The PR is ready to be reviewed.

            If UI tests are needed, consider adding a Galen test to cover the changes. üöÄ
